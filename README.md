<h2>Wordally</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p align="justify">Wordally is digital solution for those who seek efficient way <strong>to learn foreign language vocabulary</strong> for school purposes or to extend terminology stock. Acquire habit to study vocabulary like in Wordally scheme to shorten the time needed to memorize and strengthen memory. Implemented idea comes from author's private experience from learning english words. 
 
> Method relies on 3 steps. In first two, cover one column and try to guess hidden words by looking at visible column, then swap(do the same for opposite column). If you don't know something, don't worry just repeat that step few times. It's also worth to not guess words in the same order. In last step, write translations on sheet of paper(again, don't always write them in the same order) and then try to write all words. It's that simple. By doing that method at least 3 times(with breaks between each try) it's possible to learn terminology in 30 minutes(motivation also matters) :) </p>
